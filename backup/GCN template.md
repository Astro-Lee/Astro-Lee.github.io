# GRB 240411B: GMG optical observation

```
R.-Z. Li, B.-T. Wang, J. Mao,       and J.-M. Bai (YNAO, CAS) report:

We observed the field of GRB 240411B (Li et al., GCN 36063, T0 at 15:32:54 UT) using the GMG-2.4m telescope at the Lijiang Observatory. The observation began at 2024-04-11T21:55:31, approximately 6.4 hours after the trigger.

The optical counterpart of GRB 240411B, not visible in the Pan-STARRS1 r-band image, was (marginally/clearly) detected at the coordinates (J2000):
RA  = 15h 26m 10.15s
DEC = -02d 08' 47.0"
, with a positional uncertainty of 1" or better.

The preliminary analysis results are shown as follows:
--------------------------------------------------
Tmid-T0 [s]	filter	mag		5-sigma UL
--------------------------------------------------
23257 ± 300	R	21.16 ± 0.15	22.64
--------------------------------------------------
The given magnitudes are derived based on calibration against Pan-STARRS1 field stars and are not corrected for the expected Galactic foreground extinction, corresponding to a reddening of E(B-V) = 0.138 mag in the direction of the optical counterpart (Schlafly & Finkbeiner 2011).

We acknowledge the staff at the Lijiang Observatory for conducting the observation.

R.-Z. Li, B.-T. Wang, J. Mao,       and J.-M. Bai (YNAO, CAS) report:

We observed the field of GRB 240411B (Li et al., GCN 36063, T0 at 15:32:54 UT) using the GMG-2.4m telescope at the Lijiang Observatory. The observation began at 2024-04-11T21:55:31, approximately 6.4 hours after the trigger.

No any optical counterpart of GRB 240411B was detected within the XRT/EP-WXT/EP-FXT/VT error circle (GCN XXX).

The preliminary analysis results are shown as follows:
----------------------------------
Tmid-T0 [s]	filter	5-sigma UL
----------------------------------
23257 ± 300	R	22.64
----------------------------------
The given magnitudes are derived based on calibrating against Pan-STARRS1 field stars.
